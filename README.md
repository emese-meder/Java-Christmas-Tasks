# Java Christmas Tasks

**The Task:** to test if the FizzBuzz Code works according to the program requirements and to fix the code so that it does.

## Requirements of the FizzBuzz Program 

1. Returns a list of strings
2. Accepts a list of integers
3. Returns "Fizz" for multiples of 3 (but not 5)
4. Returns "Buzz" for multiples of 5 (but not 3)
5. Return "FizzBuzz" for multiple of bot 3 and 5 (ie multiples of 15)
6. Returns the number otherwise


##Tests needed: 

1. divisibleBy(4,2) should return true
2. divisibleBy(3,2) should return false
3. fizzBuzzGenerator(1,15) should return ["1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz", "Fizz", "7", "8", "Fizz", "buzz", "11", "Fizz", "13", "14", "FizzBuzz"] meaning that when 15 input as the last element in the generator, that should indeed be the last element it considers
4. Test if a list of strings is returned from a list of integers
5. Test if "FizzBuzz" is returned for multiples of both 3 and 5
6. Test if "Fizz" is returned for only multiples of 3
7. Test if "Buzz" is returned for only multiples of 5
8. Test if the same number is returned otherwise


#Next Step: 

Fix the code. 


#Rerun Test

Once the code was fixed, rerun all the tests and repeat the whole process if necessary.
